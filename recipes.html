            <h1>Chinese veg soup:</h1>

1.  Chicken stock/broth – just store bought chicken broth is fine here, but get a good quality one (Campbells in Australia is my favourite brand). Don’t use chicken stock powder with hot water for this recipe – the flavour is too chickeny.
2. Soy sauce – Don’t use dark soy sauce or sweet soy, they are too intense for this soup. See here for information about different types of soy sauces.
3. Chinese cooking wine is a key ingredient to transform store bought chicken broth into a restaurant-quality soup broth. Dry Sherry is an excellent substitute. Otherwise, Japanese cooking sake or mirin are adequate substitutes (if you use Mirin, skip sugar).
If you cannot use alcohol, I think the best sub is as follows:
Reduce soy sauce to 1 tbsp
Add 1 tbsp Oyster Sauce (this has umami and will add complexity into the broth flavour to compensate for leaving out cooking wine).
4. Extra broth flavouring options: chilli, green onion (just fold them) or onion quarters.
5. Sesame oil – use toasted (brown colour, more intense sesame flavour), not untoasted (yellow, not common in Australia).
6. Other vegetables – Any cookable vegetables will work great here! Zucchini, cabbage, other mushrooms, sweet potato, green beans, broccoli eggplant, bean sprouts. See in post for an extensive list and how to chop.
7. Chinese broccoli cutting (video is helpful) – Cut thinner stems into 2cm/0.5″ pieces, thicker stems (~1.5cm / 0.5″+) into 1cm / 1/3″ thick slices and mega thick stems (2cm+) into thin coins. 
Cut leaves into 2 cm / 0.8″ thick slices. Separate stem from leafy part (added to pot at different times).
8. Enoki mushrooms – The long thin “noodle” shaped mushrooms that I use extensively in soups when I’m aiming for low-carb, because I treat them like healthy faux noodles! Sold at large grocery stores these days though much, much cheaper at Asian stores. Use leftovers in stir fries and Asian soups (like Chinese Chicken & Corn, Hot & Sour Soup)

            <h1>Chocolate peanut butter Cake:</h1>

1. Cocoa powder – I use regular cocoa powder though you could use dutch processed for a slightly more intense chocolate flavour (not that you need more!).
2. Baking soda aka bi-carbonate soda, makes cakes etc rise like baking powder but it’s ~3x stronger. They work differently in different batters, and for this one a combination of both makes the most tender cake with a near level surface. Substitute with an extra 4 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder.
3. Instant coffee powder – Optional but recommended! This unusual sounding ingredient in a chocolate cake is a little baking trick: a touch of coffee enhances the flavour of chocolate but you won’t taste coffee flavour at all. 
Be sure to use instant coffee powder (ie the type that dissolves in hot water) NOT ground coffee beans that is used for plungers and coffee machines (it doesn’t dissolve in hot water). Substitute with hot freshly brewed coffee instead of boiling water.
4. Australia – Be sure to get SOFT icing sugar, not PURE icing sugar (that’s for hard icing like Royal Icing). If you’re outside Australia, you don’t need to worry about this.
5. Peanut butter spread – I use peanut butter spread here (like Bega, Jiffy’s etc) which has salt and sugar added. If using natural unsweetened peanut butter, reduce to 6 tbsp (90g) else your frosting may be too loose (because it’s runnier).
6. Pan – Because of the decadent nature of this cake, I’ve made it as a single layer rectangle cake. You can also make it as a 2 or 3 layer 20cm/8″ cake or a 2 layer 22cm/9″ cake. Bake layers as follows:
2 x 20cm / 8″ pans – 38 minutes
3 x 20cm / 8″ pans – 25 minutes
2 x 22cm/9″ pan – 25 to 25 minutes
For round pans, best to use one that is not a spring-form as the batter is VERY thin and not even the best are 100% leak proof. The best way to combat this is to “plug” the space where the sides meets the base with butter, and place a tray on the floor of the oven to catch drips (don’t put cake pans on the tray, it affects heat circulation).

           <h1> Singapore chicken noodles:</h1>

1. Soy sauce – Use either light or all purpose soy sauce. But not dark soy sauce – flavour is too strong and the colour is too intense! More on which soy sauce to use when here.
2. Chinese cooking wine (“Shaoxing wine”) is an essential ingredient for making truly “restaurant standard” Asian noodles. Without, the flavour is missing something. Substitute with Mirin, cooking sake or dry sherry. Non alcoholic substitute – 1/3 cup (80 ml) low sodium chicken stock. Except to toss the noodles for an extra minute or two.
3. Curry powder – Just the regular stuff you get from grocery stores, like Clives and Keens (Australian brands). Avoid hot – unless you want the heat!
4. Leftovers will keep for 3 days in the fridge. Not suitable for freezing.
Nutrition per serving.

            <h1>Roasted tomato soup:</h1>

1. Tomatoes – Regular tomatoes, any red variety. Not cherry tomatoes.
2. Smoked paprika – Adds a hint of lovely warm smoky flavour into the soup. Optional! I really like it because it gives this soup an extra touch to make up for those days when I don’t have fresh basil. I’d leave it out if you don’t have smoked, rather than using regular paprika.
3. Sugar – Use this if you know the tomatoes are underripe and a bit sour. Start with 1/2 tsp then add more if needed.
4. Cream – Just a bit of cream adds a lovely mouthfeel to soups. We’re not trying to make it really rich and creamy! Butter adds a similar touch.
5. Basil – This soup is designed to taste great even if you don’t have fresh basil. Don’t buy a whole bunch just for this recipe – unless you’ve got company! And if you do, feel free to stir in lots more. 🙂
Storage – Fridge 4 days, freezer 3 months.
